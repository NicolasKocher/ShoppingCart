# ShoppingCart

This is project where I used Firebase for the first time to create a simple Shopping-Cart for mobile devices.

Instruction: 

Create your own Firebase Database and replace the link in the index.js on "appSettings" (There is a comment where to put the link)
Add item: Click on the upper box and write your item in it and click on "Add to cart"
Delete item: Click on item at the bottom to delete it.
